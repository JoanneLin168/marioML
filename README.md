# marioML
Developing a program in Python that can predict if the image inputted is Mario or another character from the Super Mario franchise using classification. 

This is a joint project by Karolina Kowalska, Joanne Lin and Benjamin Dew to gain experience in Machine Learning.

(None of us own Mario nor any other character we use to develop this project; all rights go to Nintendo for creating an amazing series of games, as well as a great cast of colourful characters)
