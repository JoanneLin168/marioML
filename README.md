# marioML
Developing a program in Python that can predict if the image inputted is Mario or another character from the Super Mario franchise using classification. 

This is a joint project by Karolina Kowalska and Joanne Lin to gain experience in Machine Learning.

(Neither me nor Joanne own Mario nor any other character we use to develop this project; all rights go to Nintendo for creating an amazing series of games, as well as a great cast of colourful characters)
